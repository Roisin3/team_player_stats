<h2>Description</h2>
This app is used to track plaayer stats over multiple teams. Stats that can be followed are games played, goals, saves, assists, blocks, shots, interceptions, passes, red cards and yellow cards.
<h2> Installation</h2>
To use this app clone from Github. In your command line navigate to the teamm_player_stats directory and run

```rake db:migrate```

then run 

```shotgun```

and go to 

```127.0.0.1:9393```

or the IP address specified by shotgun.

<h3>Future updates</h3>
In the future I would like to make stats sortable and add in color schemes based on provided team colors.
